Bag of words is a simple technique for natural language processing where text is represent as a bag of words, Where each word in text is represented by number.
It use to represent text data.
Benefits of Bag of words:-
The bag-of-words model is a simple and effective way to represent text data for machine learning. The model is easy to understand and implement, and has been shown to be effective for a variety of tasks such as classification, clustering, and information retrieval.
Drawbacks of bag of words:
   it does not take into account the order of the words. This can be a problem when trying to understand the meaning of a sentence or paragraph. 
   it does not account for different forms of a word, such as plural forms.
Some common challenges working with bag of words:
curse of dimensionality: The number of features (words) in the data can grow very quickly as the size of the corpus increases. This can make it difficult to train a model, as the number of parameters can become very large.
bag-of-words models do not account for the order of words in a text. This can be problematic for tasks such as sentiment analysis, where the meaning of a sentence can be very different depending on the order of the words.
